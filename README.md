# budgetProject_softserve

To use this app, please download the code and start with launching **index.html**

#### -------------outro--------------

If I had more time I would:

- Implement client server architecture
- Use db as a persistent data storage (mongoDB)
- Refactor using React.js
- Adapt for mobile version using React Native
- Wrap server in docker container
- Unit tests
- Enhance look&feel of the app

If you feel you have the time, you can also add some info graphics to describe expenses from all of the incomes.
Or some timetable to see how much money does someone spent/earns per day.

**Make sure to write down what you would have done if you had more time, and submit it together with the rest of the application.**

## Images

If you will find better back-image for this budget app, use it and save with the rest of the application.

## Server

To see how can it work on the server:

### 'npm install -g http-server'

And run it:

### 'http server -c-1'
